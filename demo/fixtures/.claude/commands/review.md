Review the staged changes and create a commit:

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Staged files:
!`git diff --staged --name-only`

Based on these changes:
1. Analyze the modifications
2. Generate a conventional commit message
3. Include the commit message in your response
4. Ask for confirmation before committing
